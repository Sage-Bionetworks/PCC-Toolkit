# Participant-Centered Consent Toolkit

Included in this resource are 'Design Documents and Templates' as well as 'Icons and Animations' which support a visual approach to assisting the "informedness" part of informed consent for clinical studies.

It’s a set of tools, not a product.

Our clinical protocols are available on request. Because we do not wish to imply that one can simply download one of our protocols, adapt it, and proceed to start research on humans, we do not make them openly licensed or linked here. Contact [John Wilbanks](mailto:john.wilbanks@sagebase.org) with requests for copies.

### IRB Review
These tools are provided for information, and for reuse. However, remember that any informed consent document or interface should always be reviewed by an independent ethics board – usually called an [IRB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board). **Never, ever, ever begin collecting research data about people until you get approval by an [IRB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board) for your work. And don’t assume IRB approval is enough – you should also be finding and working with ethicists as you develop studies**.

Seriously. It’s essential that you get someone outside your project to review your ethics. It’s good for you as well as your participants and your data users.
